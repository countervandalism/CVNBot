CVNBot
==================================================


Quick start
----------

Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/countervandalism/CVNBot.git`, or
[download the latest
release](https://github.com/countervandalism/CVNBot/zipball/master).


Versioning
----------

We use the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered in the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

The `-alpha` suffix is used to indicate unreleased versions in development.

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.


Build
----------
The software is written in C# and originally created as a Visual Studio Project.
We use `mono` to run the executable and `msbuild` to build the executable.

Standalone installers (you'll need both Mono and MonoDevelop. The latter provides `msbuild`):
* [mono-project.com](http://www.mono-project.com/download/)
* [monodevelop.com/Download](http://monodevelop.com/Download)

Or, if using `apt-get`, use one of these:
* [`mono-develop`](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=mono-devel) (`mono`)
* [`mono-complete`](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=mono-complete) (`mono` + `msbuild`)

Currently supported versions of Mono: **5.4**, **5.16**

Once mono is installed, build the project. The below uses Debug for local development. (See [Installation](https://github.com/countervandalism/CVNBot/wiki#installation) for how to install it properly, don't run from Debug in production!):

```bash
countervandalism/CVNBot/src/CVNBot:$ msbuild src/CVNBot.sln /p:Configuration=Debug
```

Once built, you can run it:
```bash
countervandalism/CVNBot/src/CVNBot/bin/Debug:$ mono CVNBot.exe
```
